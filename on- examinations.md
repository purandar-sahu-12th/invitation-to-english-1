### **Detailed Study Material: "On Examinations" by Winston S. Churchill**  

---

#### **1. Summary of Each Unit**  

**Unit I: The Entrance Examination**  
- Churchill describes his dislike for exams, especially Latin and mathematics, which were favored by examiners. He preferred history, poetry, and essay writing.  
- During his Harrow entrance exam, he failed to answer any Latin questions but wrote his name and a bracket around question "I." The headmaster, Dr. Weldon, judged his potential beyond the paper and admitted him.  
- Churchill was placed at the bottom of his class, and his alphabetical surname (Spencer-Churchill) kept him from rising in the school list.  

**Unit II: Learning English**  
- Churchill remained in the lowest class for a year, where he was taught English by Mr. Somervell, a skilled teacher.  
- Mr. Somervell used a color-coded system to teach sentence structure (parsing and analysis), which Churchill mastered.  
- He later excelled in English, surpassing peers who studied Latin and Greek, and advocated for prioritizing English education.  

**Unit III: The Swimming Bath Incident**  
- Churchill played a prank at the swimming pool, pushing a boy (Amery) into the water, not realizing he was a senior.  
- Amery, a top student, retaliated by throwing Churchill into the pool.  
- Churchill apologized, joking that his father was also small, which amused Amery and resolved the conflict.  

**Unit IV: Army Examination Preparation**  
- Despite poor academic performance, Churchill won a prize for reciting 1,200 lines of Macaulay’s poetry flawlessly.  
- He passed the Army preliminary exam by luck: he randomly studied New Zealand’s map, which was the exact question asked.
