#### **1. Summary of Each Stanza**  

- **Stanzas 1–4:**  
  Father Gilligan, an old priest, is exhausted from tending to his dying parishioners. One evening, as he rests, another call for help comes, making him grieve over his inability to rest. He asks God for forgiveness for his frustration.  

- **Stanzas 5–8:**  
  He kneels to pray but falls asleep. Night falls peacefully, with stars appearing and leaves rustling. God blankets the world in shade, symbolizing divine care.  

- **Stanzas 9–12:**  
  At dawn, Father Gilligan wakes horrified, realizing he failed to attend a dying man. He rides frantically to the man’s house, only to find the man died peacefully. The wife reveals another "priest" (an angel) had already come.
